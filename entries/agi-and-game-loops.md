<h1 align="center">Artificial General Intelligence and Game Loops</h1>

I'm going to be honest. I have no idea what the direction of artificial general intelligence is taking. It seems like we constantly try to treat AI, (namely machine learning learning branches) as simple input-output machines. Our minds don't work like that. We're continously moving, thinking, processing entities. There's no such thing as idling or waiting for input for us. Yes, I know that reinforcement learning algorithms are much closer to acting as a continously moving machine but I feel it's not quite there, yet.
