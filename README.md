<h1 align="center">CI's Mind</h1>

This repository is really just a collection of random thought experiments I've had. They don't really have any real purpose behind them. Over the years, I've found that writing my thoughts out in the format of a blog entry or diary or something has really helped me to organize my thoughts and inspire me to act on them. If anything in this repository catches your attention or inspires you in someway, I'm glad.

I hope you all have a wonderful day.
